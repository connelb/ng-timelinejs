1,1,0,0,1,7,0,0,mm-dd,Nephrologist,Facilitate Fresh Start,Education- Initial diagonsis,"There are multiple tests used to diagnose kidney disease. 
The first is the urine 'dip stick' test. In this test, strips of paper covered with small squares of chemical reagent are dipped in a urine specimen and the resulting color of each small square of chemical reagent is read against a chart on the bottle. These tests identify the presence of blood cells and protein in the urine. The presence of blood cells and protein in the urine indicate that there is damage to the nephrons.
The second type of test is a blood test. This measures the blood levels of urea, which is a waste by-product from the breakdown of dietary protein, and creatinine a waste product produced by the muscles. Urea and creatinine levels in the blood are good indicators of kidney function.
Creatinine levels are thought to be more reliable than blood urea levels, or BUN, as blood urea levels can vary depending upon diet, some medications, the presence of bleeding and so forth. Creatinine, on the other hand, is a product of muscle metabolism. An individual's muscle mass typically remains fairly stable from day to day, so the creatinine level in the blood is more or less constant.

1,7,10,30,1,7,11,0,mm-dd,Interventional radiologist/ Nephrologist?,Urgent-start PD Catheter Placement,,"Despite its several advantages, peritoneal dialysis (PD) is currently an underutilized form of renal placement therapy (1). The problem of PD catheter insertion is one of the main reasons for this underutilization, and emphasis has been placed on catheter placement by a nephrologist to increase PD utilization and to improve patient survival (2). In Korea, 30% of PD catheter placements were performed by a nephrologist, and from among several techniques, the classical trocar technique is still widely used by those nephrologists (3). However, serious complications such as bowel perforation or hemoperitoneum occasionally occur with the use of this method (4), and sometimes the PD catheter is inserted into the preperitoneal space. These problems make nephrologists reluctant to personally perform PD catheter insertions. Furthermore, few surgeons are committed to PD catheter insertion, which means that patients must wait for PD (2). 

Other PD catheter insertion methods include the surgical, the peritoneoscopic, and the modified Seldinger techniques (4). Of those techniques, the modified Seldinger method, using a peel-away introducer sheath kit (“peel-away sheath method”), is the technique most easily mastered by nephrologists and has results comparable to those with the other techniques. However, peel-away kits have not been available in Korea because of low domestic needs, resulting in a lack of imports. To allow nephrologists to insert a PD catheter safely and successfully in this environment, we developed an alternative to the peel-away sheath method, using a hemodialysis (HD) catheter. The present study compares the outcomes of PD catheter insertion using our method and using the classical trocar technique

Repositioning is performed in the PD procedure room under cardiorespiratory monitoring. Patients are not premedicated with analgesics or sedatives, with the exception of the very occasional patient requesting sedation. All manipulations are performed using strict aseptic techniques.
